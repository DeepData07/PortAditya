I'm an Indian ML/DS software developer with powerful Java skills, driven by goals, creativity and passion for learning and innovating.

Last worked as a Software Developer Intern at [Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited (BGSW)](https://www.bosch-softwaretechnologies.com/en/) there I worked on [NRC's for Mercedes and JLR](https://www.bosch-mobility.com/en/solutions/camera/near-range-camera/).

Outside work, I enjoy playing badminton and footbal. Off-screen, I sketch my thoughts [here](https://in.pinterest.com/singh28aditya/leisure/)!
